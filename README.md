# opencv-OSRS
This program automates cow farming in Old School RuneScape by leveraging OpenCV and a custom-trained cascade classifier model, which I trained on images of RuneScape gameplay. PyAutoGUI is used to interact with the game through mouse actions, while the image processing runs in real time.

## Credits:
This project was highly inspired, and uses code snippets and concepts from [Learn Code By Gaming's "OpenCV Object Detection in Games" Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KecMlLUuiE4&list=PL1m2M8LQlzfKtkKq2lK5xko4X-8EZzFPI). A huge thanks to them for their execellent tutorials that made this project possible.
